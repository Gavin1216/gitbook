# ðŸ”¢ Level

The initially created warships are all level 1, and you can **upgrade the warship by consuming a certain amount of ORFL**. The higher the level, the more ORFL is needed to upgrade, and the full level is level 6. ORFL can be obtained through daily mining, copy adventure, and so on.

Level is very important for warships. Raising the level of warships will increase the mining speed of warships, and can also improve the combat effectiveness of warships by randomly increasing the basic attributes of warships. Due to the limited fuel carried by warships, the mining speed of level 1 warships will **drop to 10% after more than 15 days of mining** due to inefficient operation due to lack of energy. By increasing the level to increase the fuel carried, the normal working time of the battleship can be increased.

| Level | ORFL Consumed | ESP Consumed | Effective Working Time | Rewards Multiplier | Rate of Failure |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| 1-2   | 4000          | 0            | 30 days                | 1.5                | 0               |
| 2-3   | 12000         | 0            | 50 days                | 2.25               | 5%              |
| 3-4   | 20000         | 300          | 70 days                | 3.375              | 10%             |
| 4-5   | 45000         | 800          | 100 days               | 5.0625             | 15%             |
| 5-6   | 120000        | 2000         | 150 days               | 7.59375            | 20%             |

The effective working time of a level 1 warship is 15 days. There is a possibility that the upgrade will fail when upgrading the battleship. Failure to upgrade will cause the battleship to be downgraded by one level.
