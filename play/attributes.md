### Firepower

Firepower determines the physical attack ability of warships and is the key to penetrating enemy armor. The giant main gun uses accelerated solid shells to accelerate the shells to a very high speed, resulting in great lethality. Firepower is not only an important attribute of a warship, but also an important attribute of PVE combat and PVP combat.

### Curvature engine

The curvature engine determines the speed of the warship and whether it can sail, fight and work fast without interruption. Curvature drive refers to the transformation of space-time itself to drive the spacecraft to break the insurmountable limit of the speed of light. If your battleship is fast, they will have a better chance of avoiding enemy attacks. Speed is also an important attribute in PVE combat and PVP combat.

### Energy shield

The energy shield determines the energy attack defense capability of the warship. it is an advanced defense technology that covers the charged particle field on the surface of the object. most of the energy shields can counteract various forms of directional energy flow and protect the warship from energy damage. Energy shield is also an important attribute of PVE combat and PVP combat.

### Armor

The armor determines the physical attack defense ability of the warship. The warship armor uses graphene nanocomposite technology, which can easily resist most physical attacks. The stronger the armor, the less physical damage it will suffer. The more courage a baby has, the more defensive he will be against physical damage. Armor is also an important attribute of PVE combat and PVP combat.

### Vitality

Vitality determines the anti-attack ability of warships, which refers to the ability to maintain and restore combat and navigation performance after being damaged by combat or accidents. Vitality is also an important attribute of PVE combat and PVP combat.

### Technology

The advanced degree of science and technology determines the damage of warship energy attack, which is the key to breaking the enemy's energy shield. The higher the level of scientific and technological development, the higher the energy damage of the battleship. Technology is also an important attribute of PVE combat and PVP combat.
