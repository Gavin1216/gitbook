# ðŸŒƒ Combat

### Life

The ability of the battleship to withstand damage, that is, the amount of his blood. At the beginning of entering the replica, each battleship will display its own health. When the battleship receives damage, the health will be reduced, and when the health is reduced to 0, the battleship will withdraw from the battle. At the end of a PVE or PVP battle, the battleship will restore all health.

$$
Life = 5 * vitality * (1+0.2* (battleship level-1))
$$

### Attack

An attack can cause damage to the enemy. The physical damage character's attack is a physical attack, and the energy damage character's attack is an energy attack.

$$
Physical attack = Firepower* (1+0.2* (battleship level-1))
$$

$$
Energy attack = Technology * (1+0.2* (battleship level-1))
$$

### Physical defense

The ability of a warship to withstand physical damage.

$$
Physical defense = armor * (1+ 0.2* (battleship level-1))
$$

The actual loss of the battleship when it suffers physical damage.

$$
Health = opponent's Physical attack * (0.5-1.5 random number) * 100 / (battleship's Physical defense + 100)
$$

For example, when a battleship with a defense of 100 points is attacked by an attack with a damage of 70 points, the actual damage suffered is: 70 \* 100 / (100+100) = 35. That is, the battleship will lose 35 health in this attack.

### Magic defense

The ability to resist magic damage.

$$
Magic defense = energy shield * (1+ 0.2* (battleship level-1))
$$

The actual loss of the battleship when it is damaged by magic

$$
Health = opponent's Energy attack * (0.5-1.5 random number) * 100 / (the battleship's Magic defense + 100)
$$

For example, when a battleship with 100 magic resistance is attacked by an attack with 70 damage, the actual damage it takes is: 70\*100 / (100+ 100) = 35. That is, the battleship will lose 35 health in this attack.

### Hit

The probability of hitting an opponent.

$$
Hit rate = attack square curvature engine / (attack square curvature engine + defense square curvature engine / 2)
$$

For example, when a warship with a curvature engine of 90 attacks a warship with a hit rate of 60, its hit rate is: 90 / (90 + 60/2) = 75%, that is, there is a 75% chance that the attack will hit the opponent.
