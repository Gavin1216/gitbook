Warships can **earn ORFL** from various places when there are no combats and battles. Players just need to put them in the right position and the warship will automatically start working.

Different places require different warships to work. The higher the warship level and attribute, the more ORFL players can earn.

ORFL is the currency in this game, come and earn it!
