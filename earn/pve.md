Take up arms and defend your fleet!

In the instance dungeon, the warship will defeat the invaders, challenge Boss, and get ESP and ORFL tokens. Players need to pay a certain amount of ORFL as tickets to PVE battles.

### The Dark Fleet

This is a dark fleet with dark matter technology, plundering and expanding in the universe for a long time, using advanced scientific and technological capabilities to conquer countless planets. In the face of the strong enemy, we have no way to retreat, let us rise up and defeat the enemy!

Enemies: dark Shadow Destroyer, Dark King Cruiser, Dark Emperor Cruise Carrier

Trophies: ORFL, ESP

Players need three warships to participate in PVE battles. Players can choose the difficulty they want to challenge, the greater the difficulty, the highest profit. There is no need to manage the battle or any skills during the battle, and you will be rewarded for defeating the enemy. The number of battles for each warship is limited in one day. Warships of level 3 and below can only participate once a day, and warships of level 3 or above can participate twice a day. The limit will be reset at 12:00 UTC time.
