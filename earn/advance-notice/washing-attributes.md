The Star Armament Factory can recast and transform the battleship, and the properties of the modified battleship will change randomly, which may be enhanced or weakened.&#x20;

But once you choose to transform, there is no turning back. This is the place to provide transformation opportunities for warriors.&#x20;

Each warship can only be modified for a total of 10 times, but if it exceeds it, it will not be able to carry out due to overloading of the ship's hull.&#x20;

The cost of converting a low-level battleship will be lower than that of a high-level warship, so players who want to build the best battleship should do so as soon as possible.
