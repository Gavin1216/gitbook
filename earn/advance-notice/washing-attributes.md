# ðŸŽ² Washing Attributes

The Star Armament Factory can recast and transform the warship, and the properties of the modified warship will **change randomly**, which may be enhanced or weakened.

But once you choose to transform, there is no turning back. This is a place for warriors to transform.

Each warship can only be **retrofitted 20 times in total**, and if it exceeds that, it will not be able to carry out the modification because of overloading of the warship's hull.

Do you want your warship to be superior? Look forward to it.
